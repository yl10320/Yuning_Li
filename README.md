Below are projects done by Yuning (from the most recent to the earliest).

## Market Microstructure
Consider the issue of hedging a European derivative security in the presence of microstructure noise. Simulate market data using Black-Scholes model and model efficient price cross the tick grid.

Implement two hedging strategy in Python: portfolio is rebalanced every time that the transaction price moves or only once the transaction price has varied by more than a selected value. Assess the hedging errors and compare statistically.

## Reinforcement Learning
Implement epsilon-greedy algorithm for designed game in Python. Train it against opponents with different strategies, assess how well does the proposed algorithm fare on each of these programmatic opponents.

Use the 10-armed testbed to compare with the greedy and epsilon-greedy method using upper-confidence-bound (UCB) action selection. Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that sample-average methods have for non-stationary problems.

## Data Science for Fintech, Suptech and Regtech
Implement Bech Algorithm and Guntzer Algorithm in Python to solve the Bank Clearing Problem, maximizing the total volume cleared while maintaining a specified level of cover money deposit.

Generate queues of payments and compare statistically the performances of the two algorithms for different initial balances and sizes of queue. Performances are assessed over a large number of queues using confidence intervals.

## Iterated Prisoner Dilemma
Utilized Python to simulate Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments to examine the evolutionary dynamics and patterns within the population, shedding light on strategy success and adaptation over time.

## Data Science
Applied dimensionality reduction techniques in Python to analyse large datasets. Leveraged Multi-Layer Perceptron and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to make predictions and extract valuable insights.

Employed the K-means clustering method for data grouping and conducted graph-based analysis to reveal hidden patterns and relationships within the data.

## Consumer Credit Risk
Develop a consumer credit risk model and improve the model by data processing, stepwise variable selection, segmentation, and testing.
